- Phase 2: Core Features — completed 2026-03-29, passed phase review
- Phase 3: Supporting Features — completed 2026-03-29, review passed (score 71/100)

## Phase 4 Progress
**Wave 0 — Debt Cleanup (DONE):** Shared helpers, dead code removal, -469 lines

**Wave 1 — Backend Actions (DONE):** analytics.ts, staff-management.ts, billing.ts, branding.ts, email.ts, Stripe webhook

**Wave 2 — Manager Portal Core Screens (6 tickets, DONE):**
- INN-80: Manager Dashboard — KPI MetricCards, period selector, recent requests, quick actions
- INN-82: Manager Requests — filters, bulk ops, status transitions, pagination, staff assignment
- INN-83: Manager Analytics — recharts line/bar/area charts, staff performance table, revenue, SLA compliance
- INN-85: Manager Catalog — Menu items tab (category filter + grid), Services tab (CRUD dialog + inline Switch toggle)
- INN-87: Manager Staff — roster table, invite dialog, invitation management, department change, deactivate/reactivate
- INN-88: Manager Ops — SLA config with inline editing, color-coded target times, grouped by category
- Also fixed: installed @types/qrcode (pre-existing missing types)

## Key Technical Notes
- **Next.js 16** (not 14) with React 19
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with shadcn base-nova style (@base-ui/react — NO `asChild` prop)
- **Shared PortalHeader** component with thin wrappers (StaffHeader, ManagerHeader, AdminHeader)
- **Shared helpers:** `src/lib/auth-context.ts` (auth), `src/lib/utils.ts` (formatting), `src/constants/app.ts` (transitions)
- Guest paths: /guest/*, Staff: /staff/*, Manager: /manager/*, Admin: /admin/*
- JWT claims inject app_role, hotel_id, department via custom_access_token_hook
- Middleware redirects: guest portal → /auth/guest/login, staff/manager/admin → /auth/staff/login
- Supabase project: hbqcujxpphwgkgrqpjmo (ap-south-1, ai-solutions org)
- RLS uses `is_manager_of_hotel()` SECURITY DEFINER function
- ROLES constant: GUEST, STAFF, FRONT_DESK, MANAGER, SUPER_ADMIN
- Playwright: port 3001 (avoid conflict with other ventures)
- Stub API routes deleted — recreate when implementing features

## Manual Steps Needed
- Enable JWT hook in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Hooks → Custom Access Token
- Set GitHub Secrets: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- Configure Supabase email templates for verification + password reset
